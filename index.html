        <p class="description">The solar system is a collection of celestial objects bound together by gravity, with the
            Sun at its center. It includes planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and other space objects.<br>

            <!-- **The Sun**
           - The Sun is a star and the central object of the solar system. It contains about 99.8% of the system's total mass and provides the light and energy necessary for life on Earth. Its gravity keeps the planets in orbit around it.
        
        **Planets**
           - There are eight major planets in our solar system, categorized into two groups:
             - **Inner Planets (Terrestrial Planets):** Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are rocky planets with solid surfaces.
             - **Outer Planets (Gas Giants):** Jupiter and Saturn, and **Ice Giants:** Uranus and Neptune. These planets are much larger and consist mostly of gases and ices.
        
        **Moons**
           - Many planets have moons, which are natural satellites that orbit around them. For example, Earth has one moon, while Jupiter has over 70 known moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system.
        
     -->
            ?? How It All Works Together.
            - The solar system is structured with the Sun at the center, followed by the inner planets, asteroid belt,
            outer planets, and then the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud at the farthest reaches. The gravitational pull of
            the Sun governs the orbits of all these objects, creating a dynamic system in constant motion.<br>

            The solar system is just a tiny part of our galaxy, the Milky Way, which contains billions of other stars
            and planetary systems. Studying the solar system helps us understand our place in the universe and the
            forces that shape planetary formation and life.
